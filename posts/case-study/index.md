DOES THIS UPDATE?
Let's go over a few quick things:

<details style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px; margin-left: 10px;">
  <summary> <span style="margin-left: 5px">
This template was built with `@sveltejs/kit@1.0.0`
  </span>
  </summary>
   <div style="margin-left: 20px">

- second level hidden
- Bullet two

</div>
</details>
